I have not tested past or future versions,\r\nbut I would expect them to work.\r\n\r\nBecause Lua doesn't have a built-in way to iterate through directories, I used the\r\n[LuaRocks](http://luarocks.org/) module \"LuaFileSystem\". You'll need to have that module\r\ninstalled for this to work.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nStandard BSD.",
